The United Nilgiri Tea dataset contains stock market data for the UNITEDTEA.NS stock. It includes various details about the stock's performance on different trading days. The Date column shows the specific day of trading. The Open price is the stock's price at the beginning of the day, while the High and Low columns represent the highest and lowest prices reached during the day. The Close price is the final price at which the stock was traded at the end of the day. The Adjusted Close (Adj Close) is a modified closing price that accounts for stock splits and dividends. The Volume column indicates the total number of shares traded on that particular day. The Ticker column represents the stock symbol, which in this case is UNITEDTEA.NS, listed on the National Stock Exchange of India (NSE). This dataset does not have a specific target column, meaning it does not focus on predicting a particular value. Therefore, it falls under the category of an unsupervised dataset.
